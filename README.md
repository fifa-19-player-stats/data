### Danielle's Contributions
>   -Danielle Romanoff assisted in cleaning data after the raw data was split into three separate dataframes.

>   -Danielle created smaller dataframes including the Club with Club Logo to isolate the two.

>   -Danielle changed all abbreviations for positions to a clear indication of what the position was.

>   -Danielle created a couple groupby dataframes to connect player names to different skills. This
>    was not the best approach so a different direction was taken.

>   -Danielle created a new dataframe connection the nationalities to the continents they are part of. In addition, she connected the   
>    player name, overall score, club, and jersey number to thenationality and continent.
